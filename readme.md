'TestNG' folder you are seeing is a part of my ongoing project:
"WORKBOOK FOR QA BEGINNERS BY LJILJANA"
https://github.com/users/LjiljanaIT/projects/1

Here, you will find various codes that I have been writing, mainly as my homework during the training for manual and automation tester.
Training was conducted by ITbootcamp in Belgrade. For more information on this training please visit: https://itbootcamp.rs/

I hope these programs that I am offering here are going to help both to QA teachers and students.
Be free to use them, but please acknowledge the source.
Thanks,
Ljiljana.
